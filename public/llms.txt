# Catppuccin API

> A high-performance, lightweight, read-only REST API for serving Catppuccin theme data. It is built with C++ for speed and low resource usage, designed for containerized deployment via Docker.

This API is unofficial and serves data cached from public Catppuccin GitHub repositories. It is designed for high-concurrency and low-latency environments. The stack includes C++17, `nlohmann/json`, and `cpp-httplib`.
