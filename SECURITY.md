# Security Policy

The Catppuccin API team and community take security issues seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and we will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We accept vulnerability reports through two primary channels:

1.  **GitHub Security Advisories (Preferred):** You can create a new security advisory directly from our repository's "Security" tab. This is the most secure and efficient way to report an issue.
    -   [Submit a new advisory here](https://github.com/dvh-sh/catppuccin.dvh.sh/security/advisories/new)

2.  **Email:** If you are unable to use GitHub Advisories, you can send your report to `david@dvh.sh`.

### What to Include

To help us triage and resolve the issue faster, please include the following in your report:

-   A clear and descriptive title.
-   A detailed description of the vulnerability.
-   Clear, step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue.
-   The potential impact of the vulnerability (e.g., data exposure, denial of service).
-   Any suggested fixes or mitigations, if you have them.

## Our Commitment

-   We will acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within **48 hours**.
-   We will provide a timeline for addressing the vulnerability and keep you updated on our progress.
-   We will not take legal action against you for security research conducted in accordance with this policy.
-   We will publicly credit you for your discovery, unless you prefer to remain anonymous.

## Responsible Disclosure

We ask that you follow the principles of responsible disclosure:

-   **Do not** publicly disclose the vulnerability before we have had a reasonable amount of time to address it.
-   **Do not** access or modify user data without permission.
-   Act in good faith to avoid privacy violations, destruction of data, and interruption or degradation of our service during your research.

Thank you for helping keep the Catppiacin API and its users safe.
